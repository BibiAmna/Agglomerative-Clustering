# Agglomerative-Clustering
In this Project I have classified animals in clusters using Agglomerative Clustering.
link for dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/zoo-animal-classification"

Perform Agglomerative clustering with the appropriate MSE values

Consider the dataset "zoo.csv", and look at the information provided in first five rows.

Find solutions of following questions:

Identify the unique number of high-level classes.
Perform Agglomerative clustering using 16 intermediate features
Compute the mean-squared error by comparing the actual high level class and predicted hig level class.
